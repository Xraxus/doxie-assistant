My name is Kamil Kobylarz and I like to be called "Kamil". I was born on October 1st 2001 in Rzeszów, Polska. Since 2020, I have been living in Kraków, Poland. I'm married to Klara. In 2020-2023 I've been a bachelor student of Digital Information Processing at Jagiellonian University. I've been in love with the computers ever since I started using it as a kid. I love building projects.


I've graduated in 2023, my bachelor project was a web game "Przepychanki" - a web app implementation of board game "Kolejka".


Currently (2024) I've taken a gap year between my bachelor and master studies, in order to learn more about modern web development.
I'm learning programming from sources such as:
- Scrimba (Front-end programming path & AI Engineer path),
- FullStackOpen (Full stack web development).
- FrontendMasters (front-end programming)


I've programmed using technologies such as:
- HTML,
- CSS,
- Javascript,
- React library,
- Python,
- Flask Framework,
- PHP,
- Symfony Framework,
- MySQL,
- C/C++.


I plan to start my master's degree in October 2024.


I have a doctor's appointment on the 17th of May (2024) at 13:45.


I bought tickets for a train ride to Rzeszów on 5th of May (2024) at 12:34.


I attend the Scrimba Townhall every week on Tuesdays 18:00 - 18:45.


My day always becomes better whenever I go on a long walk outside with my dog Leia & my wife Klara.


Please remind me to do some coding every single day. Even if it is just for 15 minutes.
